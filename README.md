Big O
=====

A big collection of data structures and algorithm puzzles.
As of May 2013, the repository has roughly 130 problems with solutions.

Most solutions are written in Java (under [java/](https://github.com/kowshik/big-o/tree/master/java)) with some written in Ruby (under [ruby/](https://github.com/kowshik/big-o/tree/master/ruby)).

Problems are described in Javadoc at the top of each solution. I have tried to be as descriptive as I can, but, if something is not clear, then please do let me know!
Problems are broadly classified into the following categories, which are self explanatory.

Please, feel free to contribute!
